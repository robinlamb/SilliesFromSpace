This is my entry for the 2021 Js13kgames Game Jam.  The purpose of the jam is to make a Javascript game that is 13kb or less in a compressed folder.  This game is a memory game where you repeat the pattern of a silly alien character, and if you complete it correctly, another alien will appear and repeat the pattern, adding another movement to the sequence.  The aliens will have random colors and features.  The player's score will be displayed at the end of the game and it will be compared to the high score, which will be stored in local storage.

The game has 3D graphics made with the awesome [CSS3Dframework](https://github.com/xem/CSS3Dframework) by xem.  It also uses the [Unicode 13 Emoji](https://xem.github.io/unicode13/emoji.html) by xem which is allowed in the game jam to make emojis cross-browser compatible, so you can use emojis for graphics to save space.  I made the sound effects with [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) by KilledByAPixel and the music with [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/) by Keith Clark and Frank Force.
